# What happened
On July 18th, 2024, I was alerted that I may have been eligible for money if I had bought a device with Google Assistant. I had done this multiple times in the past.

Upon further investigation, I discovered that Google was using this as a way to prevent me from suing them.
Turns out, unless I give up a ridiculous amount of private information, I am not allowed to take legal action against Google for recording my voice data without my consent or knowledge.

While I refuse to give up my personal information, I am outraged upon this activity.

# How Google tried to stop me from noticing
Google had marked the email as spam in an attempt to prevent me from reading or even noticing the email.
